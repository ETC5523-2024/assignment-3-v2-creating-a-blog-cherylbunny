I am an aspiring professional with a background in hospitality and a current focus on Business Analytics. 

My journey has taken me from learning the nuances of human interactions to navigating the tech-savvy world during the roller coaster ride of covid. Now, I’m excited to apply my analytical skills to tackle complex challenges across various industries.

I thrive on transforming binary thinking into a more nuanced, data-informed perspective, leveraging diverse resources and tools to dissect every corner of the world through a logical lens. If you have a question or a project that could benefit from a fresh analytical approach, I’d love to connect. 

My areas of interest include:

* Leveraging data analytics to drive strategic decision-making for businesses 

* Examining user behaviour to improve product features and enhance UI/UX

* Utilizing analytical techniques to uncover insights
