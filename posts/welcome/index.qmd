# Glimpse of our conclusion
This blog dives into the size, themes, and economics of World Expos versus Specialised Expos. In short, World Expos tend to be costlier, attract bigger crowds, and involve more countries, while Specialised Expos are more predictable and smaller in scale. Interestingly, even though Specialised Expos often cost more on average, World Expos consistently draw in more visitors and international attention. Just keep in mind, some of the World Expo costs are outliers, so the data might be a bit skewed.

# Introduction

World Expos and Specialised Expos are massive global events that highlight the latest in technology, culture, and international collaboration. They put the host country in the spotlight and draw attention from around the world.

These expos don’t just attract visitors; they also drive economic growth. From boosting GDP to creating jobs and sparking economic activity through spending and supply chains, the impact is significant. That said, the size and cost of hosting these events can vary a lot.

This report digs into how hosting costs connect with the size of the event, based on the number of visitors and participating countries, for both World and Specialised Expos. Understanding these links can help future hosts make smarter plans and investments. However, it’s important to remember that some cost outliers—especially for World Expos—might make trends a little tricky to pin down.

# Results 

### Comparison of Average Attending Countries
Global participation in both World and Specialised Expos has seen a steady rise over the years.

For both event types, the number of participating countries has grown, with World Expos consistently leading the way, particularly after 1950. In fact, some World Expos after 2000 featured more than 150 countries. While Specialised Expos operate on a smaller scale, they've also experienced an increase in international involvement, highlighting the broader trend of growing global engagement.

```{r avg-attend-comparison}
#| label: fig-att-cntry
#| fig-cap: "Average Attending Countries Over Time"

# Separate data set by type of Expo
expo_world <- worlds_fairs %>% filter(category == "World Expo")
expo_spec <- worlds_fairs  %>% filter(category == "Specialised Expo")

# Calculate average attending countries per year for both Expo
avg_attend_world <- expo_world %>%
  group_by(start_year) %>%
  summarise(avg_countries = mean(attending_countries, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(expo_type = "World Expo")

avg_attend_spec <- expo_spec %>%
  group_by(start_year) %>%
  summarise(avg_countries = mean(attending_countries, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(expo_type = "Specialised Expo") 

avg_attend_combined <- bind_rows(avg_attend_world, avg_attend_spec) %>%
  mutate(avg_countries = round(avg_countries, 0))

# Visualise the trend of attendance over time 
avg_attend_plot <- ggplot(avg_attend_combined, aes(x = start_year, y = avg_countries, color = expo_type)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) + 
  theme_linedraw() + 
  ggtitle("Average Attending Countries Over Time") +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Average Number of Attending Countries") +
  scale_color_manual(name = "Exposition Type", values = c("World Expo" = "#00AFBB", "Specialised Expo" = "#FC4E07"))

print(avg_attend_plot)
```

### Correlation between Area Size and Number of Visitors

There's a clear connection between venue size and visitor numbers for both World and Specialised Expos.

World Expos, with their larger venues, often draw over 40 million visitors, showing their grander scale. Specialised Expos follow a similar pattern, but on a smaller scale, with smaller venues attracting fewer visitors.

The numbers suggest that while bigger venues do lead to more visitors in both cases, the effect is much stronger for World Expos. Larger venues come with more variation and unpredictability in attendance for these events.

```{r cor-area-vstr}
#| label: fig-area-vstr
#| fig-cap: "Area vs. Visitors"
# lm scatter plot 
world_lm_plot <- ggplot(expo_world, aes(x = area, y = visitors)) +
  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.6, color = "#00AFBB") + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', color = "#00AFBB", size = 1.5) + 
  theme_classic() + 
  ggtitle('World Expo') +
  xlab('Area (1000s of m²)') +
  ylab('Visitors (Millions)')

spec_lm_plot <- ggplot(expo_spec, aes(x = area, y = visitors)) +
  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.6, color = "#FC4E07") + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', color = "#FC4E07", size = 1.5) + 
  theme_classic() + 
  ggtitle('Specialised Expo') +
  xlab('Area (1000s of m²)') +
  ylab('Visitors (Millions)')

grid.arrange(world_lm_plot, spec_lm_plot, ncol = 2)
```

### Top theme of Expos

World Expos focus on broad, universal themes like arts and industry, while Specialised Expos target specific issues like water and energy, offering a more focused exploration.

This distinction reflects the broader scope of World Expos and the more targeted nature of Specialised Expos.

```{r top-theme}
#| label: fig-word-thm
#| fig-cap: "Top Words in Themes"
#| fig-pos: "H"
# Tokenize the themes
themes_words <- worlds_fairs %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, theme) %>%
  count(category, word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  ungroup()

# Remove unnecessary words
themes_words <- themes_words %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = "word")

# Get the top 10 most common words and plot them 
top_words_world <- themes_words %>%
  filter(category == "World Expo") %>%
  top_n(10, n)

top_words_world_plot <- ggplot(top_words_world, aes(x = reorder(word, n), y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#00AFBB") + 
  coord_flip() +
  xlab('Word') +
  ylab('Frequency') +
  theme_minimal()

top_words_spec <- themes_words %>%
  filter(category == "Specialised Expo") %>%
  top_n(10, n)

top_words_spec_plot <- ggplot(top_words_spec, aes(x = reorder(word, n), y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#FC4E07") + 
  coord_flip() +
  xlab('Word') +
  ylab('Frequency') +
  theme_minimal()

grid.arrange(top_words_world_plot, top_words_spec_plot, ncol = 2)

```

### Relationship between Ecnomic Factors and Scale of Expo

World Expos tend to have a lower median cost (40.00) but a much higher average cost (557.89), thanks to a few high-cost outliers. They also draw bigger crowds, averaging 21.76 million visitors and 45.89 participating countries. In comparison, Specialised Expos, while more consistent in cost, attract smaller audiences, with an average of 11.31 million visitors and 36.86 countries.

```{r com-eco-scl}
